# 27410 - Group assignment - Group [13] - [Psilocybin production in Corynebacterium glutamicum]

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.\
Psilocybin production in corynebracterium.

It is desired to modify the host cell to adapt it for production of new materials. A model for Corynebacterium glutamicum is modified to allow the production of psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound. Using a series of introduced enzymatic reactions, tryptophan naturally present in the bacterium can be converted into the desired product. 

It is desired to maximize the production of psylocibin while maintaining an acceptable growth rate. For this, it is desired that the production rate and yield of psylocibin in the engineered Corynebacterium should be similar to that found in comparable projects for the expression of psylocibin in a microorganism. 
Gene optimization methods will be applied to the cell model to improve the theoretical yield of the product.
