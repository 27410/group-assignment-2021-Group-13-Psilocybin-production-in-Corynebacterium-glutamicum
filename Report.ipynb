    "Psilocybin is a prodrug of the psychedelic active drug Psilocin. It is a common compound in many species of fungi and is known as the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”. Psilocin is an agonist of several of the 5-HT serotonin receptors. These receptors are responsible for sensing the presence and level of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for both many mental functions like mood, learning, the reward system cognition etc., but also some physiological function like vomiting. Psilocybin have shown potential as a treatment for many mental disorders regarding patients’ mood. Significant improvements to patients with depression and to patients with “existential distress”, which some cancer patients can experience during and after treatment, have been have observed after the administration of small doses of Psilocybin.

    "The drug market has always been in a constant state of growth, but during the last 10 years we have observed a significant increase in the use of psychedelics as a treatment for mental affliction. Seemingly in conjunction with the liberation of some of the previously controlled drugs, it has been estimated that by year 2023 will have seen more than a doubling from 2016 in the drug market of serotonin antagonist; and this number is only expected to further increase as the world begins to open more up to the idea of treating mental illnesses with psychedelics and drug alike."

    "Psilocybin is a derivative of the amino acid L-Tryptophan. The conversion of L-Tryptophan requires 4 enzymes L-Tryptophan decarboxylase (L-Tryptophan → Tryptamine), Tryptamine 4-monooxygenase (Tryptamine → 4-Hydroxytryptamine), 4-Hydroxytryptamine kinase (4-Hydroxytryptamine → Norbaeocystin) and Psilocybin synthase (Norbaeocystin  → Baeocystin) (Baeocystin  → Psilocybin). Psilocybin will quickly get dephosphorylated under acidic or alkaline conditions into the active psychedelic drug Psilocin. Psilocin can be rephosphorylated back into Psilocybin by 4-Hydroxytryptamine kinase, meaning that an overexpression of the genes for 4-Hydroxytryptamine kinase can shift the equilibrium to Psilocybin. This study will attempt to design a metabolic pathway in Corynebacterium Glutamicum for the expression and production of Psilocybin. The synthetic pathway utilizes C. Glutamicum’s own metabolic pathways using substrates like starch, which enters glycolysis and is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphoenolpyruvate then enters the Tryptophan biosynthesis where it is further converted to L-Tryptophan, which can then be converted to the desired compound, by the introduction of the beforehand mentioned enzymes."

    "The gram-positive bacteria Corynebacterium glutamicum is a well-known industrial workhorse used in industrial biotechnology traditionally for the production of amino acids1, such as L-glutamate2,3, L-lysin4,5, L-arginine6 and L-trypotophan7. The product portfolio for C. glutamicum meanwhile counts more than 70 different compounds such as bulk chemicals8,9, biofuels10,11, materials12, and high-value ingredients, with applications ranging for food, feed, human health, to well-being, including signature molecules of raspberry, savoury, and orange flavors, sun blockers, anti-ageing sugars, and polymers for regenerative medicine12,13. Moreover, in recent years C. glutamicum has become an interesting host for the expression and secretion of biotechnologically or pharmaceutically relevant heterologous proteins14. However, extensive research conducted with this host revealed that it reaches high cell densities quickly, shows no autolysis and can easily be scaled-up to large scale processes13. Furthermore, it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), allowing the synthesis of a range of products for the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is reported to utilize various carbon sources and mixtures of substrates simultaneously8,15,16. These features make C. glutamicum an excellent candidate for the use of ecologically friendly feedstock such as hydrolyzed lingo-cellulosic biomass or even waste materials for fermentations10,13,17–19. Nevertheless, it has proved to be highly tolerant towards stress, which is related to toxic compounds and other stressors13,20. This can be linked to its rather robust cell wall, which is composed of a thick glycan core21,22.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides various advantages of C. glutamicum as a cell-factory, there are still a few drawbacks especially when it comes to protein expression. When compared with the most used host for protein production, Escherichia coli, applying C. glutamicum as host faces problems like lower protein yield 23–25 and lower transformation efficiency26. Furthermore, in most cases C. glutamicum is transformed via a combination of electro-pulsing and heat-shock27, making transformations of this organism more costly, when compared to the possibility of chemically competent E. coli cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The production of the potential drug for various psychological and neurological affliction psilocybin would broaden the portfolio of products of C. glutamicum even more towards the human health area. Previously psilocybin was successfully produced by E. coli28 and S. cerevisiae29, either starting the synthetic pathway from 4-hydroxyindole or L-tryptophan, respectively. C. glutamicum is not producing endotoxins and thus gives a great advantage, when compared with E. coli cultures for the subsequent downstream processing.30 Besides the use of C. glutamicum for the production of L-tryptophan7,31, the production of violacein32  and brominated L-tryptophan33 underline the potential of C. glutamicum as cell-factory of L-tryptophan derived compounds and thus was selected as promising candidate for the production of L-tryptophan derived psilocybin.
