    "Psilocybin is a prodrug of the psychedelic active drug Psilocin. It is a common compound in many species of fungi and is known as the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”. Psilocin is an agonist of several of the 5-HT serotonin receptors. These receptors are responsible for sensing the presence and level of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for both many mental functions like mood, learning, the reward system cognition etc., but also some physiological function like vomiting. Psilocybin have shown potential as a treatment for many mental disorders regarding patients’ mood. Significant improvements to patients with depression and to patients with “existential distress”, which some cancer patients can experience during and after treatment, have been have observed after the administration of small doses of Psilocybin.

    "Psilocybin is a derivative of the amino acid L-Tryptophan. The conversion of L-Tryptophan requires 4 enzymes L-Tryptophan decarboxylase (L-Tryptophan → Tryptamine), Tryptamine 4-monooxygenase (Tryptamine → 4-Hydroxytryptamine), 4-Hydroxytryptamine kinase (4-Hydroxytryptamine → Norbaeocystin) and Psilocybin synthase (Norbaeocystin  → Baeocystin) (Baeocystin  → Psilocybin). Psilocybin will quickly get dephosphorylated under acidic or alkaline conditions into the active psychedelic drug Psilocin. Psilocin can be rephosphorylated back into Psilocybin by 4-Hydroxytryptamine kinase, meaning that an overexpression of the genes for 4-Hydroxytryptamine kinase can shift the equilibrium to Psilocybin. This study will attempt to design a metabolic pathway in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* for the expression and production of Psilocybin. The synthetic pathway utilizes *C. glutamicum*’s own metabolic pathways using substrates like glucose, which enters glycolysis and is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphoenolpyruvate then enters the Tryptophan biosynthesis where it is further converted to L-Tryptophan, which can then be converted to the desired compound, by the introduction of the beforehand mentioned enzymes."

    "The gram-positive bacteria *Corynebacterium glutamicum* is a well-known industrial workhorse used in industrial biotechnology traditionally for the production of amino acids[1], such as L-glutamate[2], [3], L-lysin[4], [5], L-arginine[6] and L-trypotophan[7]. The product portfolio for *C. glutamicum* meanwhile counts more than 70 different compounds such as bulk chemicals[8], [9], biofuels[10], [11], materials[12], and high-value ingredients, with applications ranging for food, feed, human health, to well-being, including signature molecules of raspberry, savoury, and orange flavors, sun blockers, anti-ageing sugars, and polymers for regenerative medicine[12], [13]. Moreover, in recent years *C. glutamicum* has become an interesting host for the expression and secretion of biotechnologically or pharmaceutically relevant heterologous proteins[14]. However, extensive research conducted with this host revealed, that it reaches high cell densities quickly, shows no autolysis and can easily be scaled-up to large scale processes[13]. Furthermore, it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), allowing the synthesis of a range of products for the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is reported to utilize various carbon sources and mixtures of substrates simultaneously[8], [15], [16]. These features make *C. glutamicum* an excellent candidate for the use of ecologically friendly feedstock such as hydrolyzed lingo-cellulosic biomass or even waste materials for fermentations[10], [13], [17]–[19]. Nevertheless, is has proofed to be highly tolerant towards stress, which is related to toxic compounds and other stressors[13], [20]. This can be linked to its rather robust cell wall, which is composed of a thick glycan core[21], [22]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides various advantages of *C. glutamicum* as a cell-factory, there are still a few drawbacks especially when it comes to protein expression. When compared with the  most commonly used host for protein production, *Escherichia coli*, applying *C. glutamicum* as host faces problems like lower protein yield [23]–[25] and lower transformation efficiency[26]. Furthermore, in most cases *C. glutamicum* is transformed via a combination of electro-pulsing and heat-shock[27], making transformations of this organism more costly, when compared to the possibility of chemically competent E.coli cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "The production of the potential drug for various psychological and neurological affliction psilocybin would broaden the portfolio of products of *C. glutamicum* even more towards the human health area. Previously psilocybin was successfully produced by *E. coli*[28] and *S. cerevisiae*[29], either starting the synthetic pathway from 4-hydroxyindole or L-tryptophan, respectively. *C. glutamicum* is not producing endotoxins and thus gives a great advantage, when compared with *E. coli* cultures for the subsequent downstream processing.[30] Besides the use of  *C. glutamicum* for the production of L-tryptophan[7], [31], the production of violacein[32]  and brominated L-tryptophan[33] underline the potential of *C. glutamicum* as cell-factory of L-tryptophan derived compounds and thus was selected as promising candidate for the production of L-tryptophan derived psilocybin. \n"

In order to achieve this a model for *Corynebacterium glutamicum* (iCW773) [1] is modified, by the addition of a synthetic pathway, to allow the production of psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound, which is currently seen as promising future medicine in order to treat depressions and other mental afflictions. \n",
    "For implementation of the synthetic pathway we are introducing a series of enzymatic reactions, which were already reported and successfully implemented to *S. cerevisiae*[2]. The synthetic pathways starts from the amino-acid L-tryptophan, which is naturally present in *C. glutamicum*. Previously, *C. glutamicum* was successfully used for the production of L-tryptophan derived products, such as violacein or brominated L-tryptophan[3], [4]. Thus, the production of psilocybin from L-tryptophan was selected as promising strategy for this project.\n",

Optimally, *C. glutamicum* shows higher potential for the production of psilocybin than previously engineered cell-factories such as *S. cerevisiae* or *E.coli*[2], [5]. \n",

    "As stated before, *C. glutamicum* is a common industrial workhorse used for a wide range of applications. Therefore, some efforts have been made to simulate this organism in silico for valuable compounds’ yield prediction. The first genome-scale model of C. glutamicum was published by Kjeldsen and Nielsen in 2009 for the strain ATCC 13032. This model comprised 446 reactions and 411 metabolites. Although comparable flux values between in silico and experimental values were seen, some differences in the phenotypic behavior were observed [X]. Yohei and collaborators made a new GSM for the same strain. Their metabolic network included 277 genes, 502 metabolic reactions, and 423 metabolites. This model was curated thoroughly, i.e., it was not just a collection of all publicly available data. Furthermore, the researchers stated that their model simulated different oxygen uptake rates better than the previous GSM published [Y]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the other hand, there is another strain of *C. glutamicum* that has been used as a workhorse, namely, S9114. This strain is used for glutamate production due to its particularly high resistance to sugars and glutamate. Mei et al., made a tailored GSM for this strain due that previous GSMs lacking a complete glutamate metabolic pathway. Therefore, none of the two models could be used to study glutamate metabolism. The model, named iJM658, comprised 658 genes, 984 metabolites and 1065 reactions [Z]. It was used to predict essential genes, investigate glutamate metabolism, and evaluate the capacity of g-aminobutyrate and l-isoleucine production by S9114. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last GSM described for *C. glutamicum* was published in 2017 by Zhang and collaborators [XX]. They updated the previous model of the *C. glutamicum* ATCC 13032 metabolic network reconstruction. This new model, named iCW773, consisted of 773 genes, 950 metabolites, and 1207 reactions. It supplemented 496 gene-protein reaction associations, refined five lumped reactions, balanced the mass and charge, and constrained the directionality of reactions. Furthermore, overproduction simulations for L-lysine, 1,2-propanediol, isobutanol, as well as de novo L-proline overproducing strain were highly consistent with experimental data. Moreover, this model has been used lately to simulate production of trans-4-hydroxyproline [YY] and hyaluronic acid [ZZ], and decoupling L-serine catabolism from cell growth [XXX]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite of the fact that many GSMs are published for *C. glutamicum*, we could only have access to iCW773 and iJM658. However, only iCW773 was readable by COBRApy package and suitable to perform a MEMOTE analysis. In Table 1 all models are summarized."

This balance could be unfavorable for metabolic engineering. A good example for such a balance are the co-factors NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH. Actually, there are several enzymes reported to be able to use both as co-factors. Furthermore, it’s possible to engineer enzymes towards use of both co-factor or to change their preference towards another co-factor. In order to identify targets, where co-factor swapping would result in higher production of psilocybin, we tried Cameo’s Co-factor swapping algorithm. As this did not result in any suggested targets, co-factor swapping seems to be no promising strategy for our product, psilocybin. "
